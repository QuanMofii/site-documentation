This site (PROJECT_NAME) is built with a simple, fast, and flexible theme for modern static websites. The theme is especially well-suited for documentation but can also be used for blogs, portfolios, and more.

Hugo, like Jekyll, is a static site generator. What sets Hugo apart is that it is a single binary, making it easy to install and run on various platforms. It is also extremely fast and reliable, capable of rendering a site with thousands of pages in milliseconds.

The theme is built with a mindset focused on having a minimal footprint. To get started, no extra dependencies like Node.js packages are required; all you need is a single YAML configuration file, along with your Markdown content. Thus, we can focus on writing quality content instead of setting up tooling.
